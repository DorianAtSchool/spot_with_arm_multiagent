# Spot-with-Arm Isaac Sim Examples

This folder mirrors the structure of the top-level `isaacExamples` directory,
but is specialized for the **Spot-with-arm** robot used in this project.

All examples assume Omniverse Isaac Sim 5.1 **standalone** is installed and
accessible via its Python launcher on Windows:

```bash
D:\isaacsim\isaac-sim-standalone-5.1.0-windows-x86_64\python.bat
```

Adjust the base path if Isaac Sim is installed elsewhere.

## Layout

All paths below are relative to the `multi_agent_spot` repository root.

- `spot/examples/assets/`  
  Placeholder for any additional USD assets or textures needed by the
  Spot-with-arm example tasks (beyond `spot/spot_with_arm.usd` itself).

- `spot/examples/data/`  
  Output directory for logs, images, or videos generated by the example tasks
  in `spot/examples/src/tasks`.

- `spot/examples/scripts/`  
  Simple convenience launch scripts (optional) for running the examples with
  the Isaac Sim Python launcher (similar to `isaacExamples/scripts`).

- `spot/examples/src/`  
  Python modules for Spot-with-arm example tasks.

  - `spot/examples/src/tasks/`  
    High-level task entrypoints built around the Spot-with-arm USD and
    (optionally) policies exported from Isaac Lab.

## Running the Spot-with-Arm Tasks

All tasks in this folder are intended to be launched via Isaac Sim’s bundled
Python. From the repo root:

```bash
D:\isaacsim\isaac-sim-standalone-5.1.0-windows-x86_64\python.bat spot/examples/src/tasks/test_spot_with_arm_nav.py
```

The example task scripts should:

- load `spot/spot_with_arm.usd` at `/World/Spot`,
- create a simple environment (ground plane, optionally cameras),
- and either:
  - drive Spot with scripted base/arm commands, or
  - use a policy exported from Isaac Lab (e.g., `spot/spot_policy.pt`).

Refer to the docstrings and inline comments inside each `test_*.py` file for
task-specific behavior, logging, and output locations under
`spot/examples/data/`.
